A Tiled JSON map renderer for pyglet
------------------------------------

These classes use the JSON format as generated by Tiled JSON plugin to
render the maps with pyglet (1.2+).

The `Map` class will use internally a `Batch` to render the map in the most
efficient way, although the `Map.draw()` method has to be used as it will apply
the required transforms to the batch.

A map can be loaded with `Map.load_json(fileobj)`. Before rendering the map a
viewport has to be specified with `Map.set_viewport(x, y, width, height)`.

`pyglet.resource` framework is used to load all the elements of the map, so
any path information must be removed from the tileset.


Loading a Map
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A map can be loaded using `Map.load_json()`::

    # use pyglet's resource framework
    fd = pyglet.resource.file("map.json")
    m = Map.load_json(fd)
    # set the viewport
    m.set_vieport(0, 0, 320, 200)

The viewport has to be set *once* so the Map class knows which area is available
to draw the map.


Drawing the Map
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The map will be drawn using a batch that is exposed in `Map.batch`, but because
some transformations need to be applied to the batch, the method `Map.draw()`
must be used::

    # in your draw code
    m.draw()

See `example/basic_render.py` for a complete example.


Changing the focus
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If the map is larger than the are available to draw it, it is possible to specify
which part of the map will be draw by using the `Map.set_focus(x, y)` method.


Invalidating the batch
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The map will update the batch only then is required (eg, the focus changed and
the part of the map to be drawn is different). If you change part of the map data
and the batch information is not up to date, `Map.invalidate()` can be used to
force a regeneration of the batch.

Calling `Map.invalidate()` frequently can affect the application performance.


Translating coordinates
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

World coordinates can be translated to screen coordinates with `Map.world_to_screen(x, y)`.
This can be useful to determine if an element is visible on screen or not.


Accessing to Map data
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Every element of the map has a `data` property that contains a dictionary with the
actual JSON data, but that information can be access using a *pythonic* interface.

Also the `Map` class provides access to the layers with:

- `Map.layers`: list with **all** the layers.
- `Map.tilelayers`: dictionary with the tile layers indexed by name.
- `Map.objectgroups`: dictionary with the object group layers indexed by name.

The tile layer interface provides access to the tiles, for example::

    # list all the tiles
    for tile in m.tilelayers["Walls"]:
        print tile

    # get one especific tile
    print m.tilelayers["Walls"][10, 10]


The object group layer interface provides access to the objects, for example::

    # list all the objects
    for obj in m.objectgroups["Objects"]:
        print obj

    # is there a "Door1" object?
    print "Door1" in m.objectgroups["Objects"]

    # is there aan object in coords 10, 10?
    print (10, 10) in m.objectgroups["Objects"]

    # get the object named "Door1"
    print m.objectgroups["Objects"]["Door1"]

    # get the object in coords (5, 3)
    print m.objectgroups["Objects"][5, 3]

    # list all the objects with type "Door":
    for obj in m.objectgroups["Objects"].get_by_type("Door"):
        print obj



Adding unmanaged sprites to the Map
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In order to get the best performance any `Sprite` can be added to the Map's batch
even it won't be managed by the Map itself.

There are some things to take into account:

- The sprite should be added to the Map's batch using an `OrderedGroup` with number 
  >= `Map.last_group` (or it may not be visible).
- The sprite coordinates are world based (instead of screen based). Also the `y` 
  coordinate has to be converted from pyglet's coordinate system to Tiled coordinate 
  system (basically: `y = SCREEN_HEIGHT-real_y-1`).

The sprite can be moved using its `x` and `y` properties *in world coordinates*.
